# Model-Centric
- In this folder, we will be adding the code for all the methods from **Model-Centric Approach** that we will be trying.

## File Descriptions
- `vgg16_model.ipynb` - This file stores the code of the VGG16 Model. It's a pre-trained model and considerable fine-tuning has been done, and has an **accuracy of 0.8733** and a **log-loss of 0.4448** on the test dataset.
- `mobilenet_model.ipynb` - This file stores the code of the MobileNet Model. It's a pre-trained model and considerable fine-tuning has been done, and has an **accuracy of 0.8501** and a **log-loss of 0.4885** on the test dataset.
- `xception_model.ipynb` - This file stores the code of the MobileNet Model. It's a pre-trained model and considerable fine-tuning has been done, and has an **accuracy of 0.8285** and a **log-loss of 0.7965** on the test dataset.
