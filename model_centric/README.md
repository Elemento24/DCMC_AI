# Model-Centric
- In this folder, we will be adding the code for all the methods from **Model-Centric Approach** that we will be trying.

## File Descriptions
- `vgg16_model.ipynb` -- This file stores the code of the VGG16 Model. It's a pre-trained model and considerable fine-tuning has been done, and has an **accuracy of 0.7992** and a **log-loss of 1.682** on the test dataset.
- `mobilenet_model.ipynb` -- This file stores the code of the MobileNet Model. It's a pre-trained model and considerable fine-tuning has been done, and has an **accuracy of 0.8668** and a **log-loss of 1.005** on the test dataset.
- `xception_model.ipynb` -- This file stores the code of the MobileNet Model. It's a pre-trained model and considerable fine-tuning has been done, and has an **accuracy of 0.8957** and a **log-loss of 0.8017** on the test dataset.
