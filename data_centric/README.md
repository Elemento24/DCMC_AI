# Data-Centric
- In this folder, we will be adding the code for all the methods from **Data-Centric Approach** that we will be trying.

## File Descriptions
- `trad_aug.ipynb` -- This `.ipynb` notebook covers the code for applying the Traditional Augmentation approaches on the Dataset and then training the Baseline Model on the Augmented Dataset. The kernel consists of 3 different approaches, random-sampling based augmentation, augmentation for class balancing, and augmentation based on class-wise performance. Out of the 3 approaches, only the random-sampling based augmentation gave a small boost that too in terms of accuracy. It gave an **accuracy of 0.7711** and a **log-loss of 0.7576** on the test dataset.
